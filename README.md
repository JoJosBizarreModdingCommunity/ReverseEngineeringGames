# Reverse Engineering Games Series

This repo is for me storing the script/resources on the REG (Reverse Engineering Games) series.

## What is REG?

REG (Reverse Engineering Games) series is meant to teach complete beginners from ground up topics that will help them in reversing a game, and modding them to their hearts content!

## Why?

It feels like there are no organized group of resources on the topic, and we at [JJBMC](https://jojomodding.com) are looking to train people in the art of reversing games to improve games! The guide mainly focuses on `Jojo's Bizzare Adventures: All Star Battle R` but, all the knowledge can be translated into other games!
