# Reverse Engineering Games Series

This repo is for me storing the script/resources on the REG
(Reverse Engineering Games) series.

## What is REG?

REG (Reverse Engineering Games) series is meant to teach complete beginners from
ground up topics that will help them in reversing a game,
and modding them to their hearts content!

## Why?

It feels like there are no organized group of resources on the
topic, and we at [JJBMC](https://jojomodding.com)
are looking to train people in the art of reversing games to improve games!
The guide mainly focuses on
`JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R` but,
***90%*** of the knowledge can be translated into other games!

## The series format

All the episodes will be available in two forms -> Text and Video.
The Text guides will be released first, and then later on transformed into
Youtube videos posted on our [channel](https://youtube.jojomodding.com).

## Episode List
