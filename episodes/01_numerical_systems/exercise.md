To compare your results with the answer you must ***hash*** your
solution using a [CRC32 algorithm](https://crc32.online/)
(to prevent spoiling the answer in case you are wrong)

To verify if you can do that try ***hashing*** the value `0x123` and compare to
this output:

`0x123` -> `0xbe817d28` (hexadecimal)
